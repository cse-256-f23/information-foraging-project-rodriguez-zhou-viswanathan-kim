        <h3>Orientation Days</h3>
        <p>
          This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the
          child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the
          teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time
          for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief
          overview of what to expect during the school year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either
          Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided
          in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule
          allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before
          the entire class attends on Friday.

          <h2>How we Help Students</h2>
          <p>
            The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and
            assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers
            consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
            meet students’ needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum
            may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the
              child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student
              confidence
            </li>
            <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
            <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
            <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
            <li>
              Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than
              previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in
              the learning process
            </li>
            <li>
              Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities
              around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern
            </li>
          </ul>
