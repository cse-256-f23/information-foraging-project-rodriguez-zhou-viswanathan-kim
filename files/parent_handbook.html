        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          Dear Parents and Guardians,
        </p>
        <p>
          At the Nursery School we strive to provide a great learning environment for 
          each and every child in our care. We recognize that a strong partnership with 
          parents and clarity about expectations for how we will work together 
          in this effort are critical. Please take time to read through this Parent Handbook 
          and to familiarize yourself with its content. It provides important information
          and helpful guidance. We ask parents to know and follow the procedures and rules 
          contained in this Handbook. We hope it will become your go-to source for information.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Nikki Scheele, Director
        </p>
        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that every child is a unique 
          individual with his or her own pattern and timetable for social, emotional, intellectual 
          and physical growth. We believe in learning through play; we provide fun, child-centered 
          activities that effectively engage students. We encourage creativity in all areas with a 
          special focus on the arts to enhance language and thinking. Above all, our goals are that
          children will develop a genuine pleasure in learning, that they develop confidence in their 
          ability to learn and to accomplish challenging tasks and that they gain experience and skills 
          in interacting with others.
        </p>
        </div>
      
      <div id="philosophy">
        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          Washington University Nursery School teachers are attentive to individual needs, serving as 
          catalysts to spark each child’s interests and desire to experiment and explore. Our school 
          provides a safe, nurturing environment that encourages growth and independence in all 
          developmental areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. 
          Our approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We 
          consider the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for 
          children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them. For each class, 
          teachers develop a curriculum that reflects the interests and abilities of the children in the classroom. 
          In addition, all children actively participate with specialists in science, art, music and Spanish. 
          As trends in the field of early education change, we evaluate what is new and determine if 
          it would be enriching for our program.

          <h3>Parent School Partnership</h3>
          <p>
            When joined by a common set of beliefs and purposes, a school and its parents form a powerful team with far-reaching 
            positive effects on children and the entire school community. As a result, WUNS relies on its parents to understand and 
            embrace the School’s philosophy and values, and fully support its curriculum, teachers/staff, and administration. 
            Working together, parents and school professionals exert a strong influence on children’s development and help them to 
            mature by modeling healthy adult working relationships based on honesty, trust, civility, and mutual respect. 
            The teachers, staff, and administration of WUNS share our parents’ commitment to their children and join them in partnership 
            dedicated to the growth of each child. This partnership begins with timely, honest and open communication between home 
            and school, and is premised on an assumption of goodwill and a shared interest in what is best for each individual child. 
            Parents can best support this climate of trust and respect by communicating concerns openly and constructively to the teacher. 
            If a satisfactory conclusion is not reached, the parent should then contact the Director. Out of respect for the individual 
            needs and privacy of each family, the Nursery School places a high value on confidentiality and expects individual families 
            to honor the same. Efforts to lobby other parents are contrary to the spirit of the Parent School Partnership. By enrolling 
            their child(ren) in WUNS, parents agree to support the School’s vision, follow its rules and policies, and abide by its decisions. 
            Just as parents can expect the Nursery School to share timely information and concerns with families concerning their child, 
            so too the Nursery School expects parents to approach issues and concerns in a spirit of mutual goodwill, using proper channels, 
            and in a manner that gives everyone the benefit of the doubt and leads to collaborative and constructive solutions. 
            While parents may not agree with every decision, in most cases, the parents and Nursery School will find enough common ground 
            to continue a mutually respectful and productive relationship. However, when it is clear that a constructive, positive relationship 
            cannot be maintained, the School reserves the right to deny continued attendance or re-enrollment.

        <div id="history">
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p> 
            The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St. Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7 months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty, staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children come from a variety of countries, cultures and economic backgrounds. The school maintains the high standards of the National Association for the Education of Young Children, by which it is accredited. It is licensed by the State of Missouri.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child development. Washington University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’ presence enables children to receive additional individual attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus. It is composed of three classrooms, which are designed to offer children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of indoor gross motor play materials. A large outdoor play area gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide and play in the sand.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="staff">
          <h3>Staff</h3>
          <p>
            The staff at the nursery school respects and appreciates the talents and personalities of each child and his or her family. A teacher’s individual talents are also encouraged as she or he develops his or her own personal approach in the classroom. This makes for a vibrant, growing community of children, families and teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, teachers hold a Bachelor or Master degree in early childhood or elementary education and/or teaching. All have extensive early childhood teaching experience. (https://nurseryschool.wustl.edu/about/staff/)
          </p>
          <p>
            Professional development is an ongoing process at WUNS. The school pays fees for workshops and conferences during the year. In addition, there are two teacher in-service days and monthly staff meetings. All teachers are certified in CPR and First Aid.

          <div id="curriculum">
            <h3>Curriculum</h3>
            <p>
              At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development. We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, play-based curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the whole child by:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language, discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Offering learning experiences that appeal to multiple senses and that provide hands- on activities using materials that encourage exploration, investigation, and learning.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group of peers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses, listening respectfully to their answers, and gently guiding them toward the answers they seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students to become problem solvers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented to children in ways that are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of the child.

            <h2>Classroom Information</h2>
            <p>
              Our classes focus on social development and learning through play. Each year’s class builds on the previous year’s program in curriculum experiences and activities offered. The classrooms are set up to invite exploration and foster a lifelong love of learning. Our staff is deeply committed to the young child and the importance of early childhood education.
            </p>
            <p id="twos-young-threes">
              Two’s/Young Three’s: Children must turn 3 by February 1 of that school year. The focus of this class is on social development and learning through play. Separating from parents, learning to take direction, and being nurtured by people outside of immediate family are important milestones for this age. The building of trust and growing peer awareness are enhanced by a safe environment that provides a foundation for learning.
            </p>
            <p id="threes-young-fours">
              Three’s/Young Four’s: The emphasis in this class is to encourage further socialization by reinforcing how a child’s choices affect their relationships and environment. There are greater expectations for participation and appropriate play practices. This class fosters independence, creativity, cognitive growth, and motor coordination. Children are introduced to phonemic awareness, patterning, number sequencing with value recognition and following both verbal and visual directions.
            </p>
            <p id="fours-young-fives">
              Four’s/Young Five’s: The intent of this class is to further support the development of social awareness, emotional intelligence, and Kindergarten readiness skills. Critical thinking, science, sequencing, sorting and classification, matching, number values, phonemic awareness, problem solving, storytelling and following multi-step directions are all incorporated in our curriculum. Children develop their gross and fine motor skills while working in large and small groups. Through play and collaborative group work, children come to appreciate the value of cooperation and contribution. The children are encouraged to take risks, helping them discover how the process of learning is often more valuable than the outcome. Mastering appropriate academic skills and fostering social emotional growth are the cornerstones of this program.
            </p>
            <h3 id="bear-tracks">Bear Tracks</h3>
            <p>
              The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but perhaps not full-day schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bear Tracks is offered Tuesday through Friday, 9:45 a.m. – 12:30 p.m., for afternoon students and Monday through Friday, 11:45 a.m. – 2:30 p.m., for morning students. Parents may enroll their children for participation in Bear Tracks for any or all days it is offered.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to free choice, outdoor time and a snack, the daily Bear Tracks schedule includes a special activity. These activities are designed to engage a smaller, multi-age group of children in hands-on learning in a specialized content area, such as art, science, movement or literacy. Bear Trackers, for example, might take a nature hike one day, create an art project the next, or dramatize a story in any particular week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main goal for the Bear Tracks program is to continue the progress children are making in their regular classroom within a varied and creative curriculum. Children must be toilet- trained to enroll in Bear Tracks.

              This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect during the school year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.
            </p>
            <h3 id="parent-staff-communication">Parent-Staff Communication</h3>
            <p>
              Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
            </p>
            <h3 id="assessment-and-parent-teacher-conferences">Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</h3>
            <p>
              Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversations and observations both in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas of their development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines and examples of the children’s writings and pictures. Teaching teams meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children.
            </p>
            <p>
              The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.

          <div id="discipline">
            <h2>Discipline</h2>
            <p>
              The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Positive reinforcement.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Naming and validating child’s feelings</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Simple, logical and immediate consequences.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community services if parents so desire.

            <h2>Policies and Procedures</h2>
            <h3 id="parking">Parking</h3>
              <p>
                Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3 parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special school events.
              </p>
            <h3 id="clothing">Clothing</h3>
              <p>
                It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are comfortable, washable, and suitable for activities both indoors and outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of clothing appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should be aware of weather conditions and dress children accordingly, as outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. During the winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will usually go outside when it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified.
              </p>
            <h3 id="snacks">Snacks</h3>
              <p>
                The nursery school provides a healthy snack each day for the children. Fresh fruit (apples, oranges, pears, bananas, melons, etc.) are purchased each week and kept in the “children’s refrigerator.” There are a wide variety of crackers (soda, graham, Ritz, Goldfish, etc.) available. Snack time consists of a fruit, crackers and water. The older children learn to pour their own water.
              </p>
            <h3 id="birthday-celebrations">Birthday Celebrations</h3>
              <p>
                We celebrate each child’s birthday (or half-birthday for children with summer dates). If desired, talk with your child’s teacher about bringing a special snack to share with the class.
              </p>
            <h3 id="holidays">Holidays</h3>
              <p>
                We are fortunate to have diverse cultures and religious beliefs in our nursery school community. Our policy is to celebrate family traditions, not the religious aspects, of holidays.
              </p>
            <h3 id="field-trips">Field Trips</h3>
              <p>
                Teachers frequently plan short walking trips on campus. Occasionally, trips are planned off- campus to further enhance the children’s experiences. Each time an off-campus trip is planned, parents will be notified in advance and required to sign a form granting permission for the child’s participation.
              </p>
            <h3 id="medication">Medication</h3>
              <p>
                The nursery school encourages parents to administer medications at home and not at school. The nursery school staff does not routinely administer medications to the children. Also, we do not apply sunscreen or insect repellent. Medication that absolutely needs to be administered during school hours must be cleared with the director.
              </p>
            <h3 id="allergies">Allergies</h3>
              <p>
                If your child has a known allergic reaction, this must be documented on the child’s History and Health Record kept in his/ her file in the office. Also, please report these allergies to the classroom teachers. For your child’s safety, these allergies will be posted in your child’s classroom. If you object to this information being posted, please contact the director. In case of severe allergies such as to bee stings or nuts, an EpiPen Injector Kit may be kept at the nursery school and used by the director and/or teachers who are trained in its administration. This is stored in the emergency backpack in the child’s classroom. Each classroom has a First Aid Kit that includes the EpiPen (if required). This, along with emergency medical forms for every child, accompanies the classes on all walking or driving field trips.
              </p>
            <h3 id="peanut-and-tree-nut-policy">Peanut and Tree Nut Policy</h3>
              <p>
                A growing number of children deal with food allergies and, specifically, potentially life- threatening peanut and tree nut allergies. Washington University Nursery School will be a peanut- and tree nut-free (Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts) preschool beginning with the 2017-2018 school year. The full explanation of the Peanut and Tree Nut Policy describes how teachers and families will support the efforts of safeguarding the health and safety of the children.
              </p>
            <h3 id="accidents">Accidents</h3>
              <p>
                The nursery school makes every effort to ensure the safety of all children. However, should a serious accident occur, a parent is immediately contacted. If parents and emergency contacts cannot be reached, we will take your child to the hospital designated on your enrollment form. Minor injuries will be reported to you by your child’s teacher at pick-up. All injuries will also be reported in written form and given to you at pickup time. We will ask you to sign an identical form to be placed in your child’s file at school.
              </p>
            <h3 id="health-policy">Health Policy</h3>
              <p>
                The nursery school makes a great effort to provide a healthy environment for your children. We work diligently on forming healthy habits such as washing hands before eating or handling food, and after toileting. Our dishes and cups are put through a dishwasher/ sanitizer to sterilize them and to prevent the spread of germs. The rooms are thoroughly cleaned daily and checked for safety. However, despite everyone’s best efforts, children and adults will get sick. It is an expected part of life. If children become ill at school, they will be cared for in the office until a parent can pick them up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Parents are requested to keep their child home in the event of the diseases or symptoms noted below. The child will be allowed to return to school when he or she has been free of these symptoms and has not required medication for a minimum of 24 hours. If a symptom persists (such as rash or cough), or if a communicable disease is confirmed (measles, chicken pox, etc.), returning to school may require a statement from the child’s physician declaring that the condition is no longer contagious.
              </p>
              <p>
                PLEASE CALL the nursery school to inform us that your child is sick, especially if he/ she has a communicable disease. Communicable diseases or conditions include:
              </p>
